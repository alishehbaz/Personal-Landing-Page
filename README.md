# Personal Landing Page

My original idea was to create my portfolio website with this certain theme in mind, but I decided to just have this as a single landing page. Now, I am currently working on portfolio website with completely different theme in my mind.

## Technologies used:

I used ReactJS for this project, I used [particle.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) and tinkered with the config a little bit to get the background. I used [baffle.js](https://camwiegert.github.io/baffle/) to get obfuscating and revealing effect. The font I used in the subheadings is [Watch Dogs Font](https://watchdogsfont.com/) by [David Libeau](https://davidlibeau.fr/) The page is live [here](https://alishehbaz.github.io/Personal-Landing-Page/).

### To run locally:

open terminal and run these commands

> ```console
> git clone https://github.com/alishehbaz/Personal-Landing-Page.git
> npm install
> npm start
> ```
